This is an Insight Project for my portfolio. The main idea is to gather information from data in order to find valuable insights to guide fictitious stakeholders, from a real estate company, in their decision making. The business of this ficticious company is to buy houses for a low price and sell these houses for a higher price. The insights found in this project will promote more accurate choices by the stakeholders, in order to thrive the company business.
